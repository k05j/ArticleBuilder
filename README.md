# Articlebuilder-Renderer

A fully self-written editor for building Articles and/or Webpages in a web-based sandbox. 
The Parts are stored in JSON format and can be interpreted by our renderer.
As this is part of a separate project, it is still to be ported -> substantial features are missing here and will be added in the next days. 

You can check it out on https://kgdevelopment-articlebuilder.netlify.app/
